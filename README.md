## Introduction

During this internship, the primary goal is to become proficient in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The tasks are designed to help you understand the core concepts of React, including components, props, and hooks, by working through the official React documentation and building practical applications. Along with this I also learnt the Mern 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Project Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
     git clone url
   
2. **Install Dependencies**
     npm install

3. **Start the Development Server:**
     npm start

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

Sure, here is the README with added breaks between the tasks:

```markdown
# Task 1: Learning React

Learn React hooks, prop passing, state, class components, JSX components, event handling, etc.

---

# Task 2: Login and Signup Page

Create a login and signup page using React. Add validation for user details.

---

# Task 3: Dashboard and Navbar

Add a dashboard and navbar using React Bootstrap components. Connect these components to the login page.

---

# Task 4: Navbar Correction and Recipes API

Correct the navbar and create a page to display recipe categories using the Recipes API. Use `fetch` in React to make API calls.

---

# Task 5: Features to the Recipe Page

Enhance the recipe page with the following features:
- List and grid layout.
- Search bar.
- Sort button.
- Separate API calls.
- URL best practices for base and endpoint.
- Loading delay using `setTimeout`.
- Local storage separation.
- Image toast on click.

---

# Task 6: Meal Page Addition

Add a meal page with a search bar delay using a debounce function.

---

# Task 7: Meals Page Correction and Backend

Correct the meals page to show meals when a category is selected. Add a dropdown button to select categories within the meals page. Implement backend for user signup using the MERN stack.
```
